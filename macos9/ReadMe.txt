Mac OS 9 build instructions for BillardGL

* billardgl.mcp and billardgl.mcp.xml are CodeWarrior Pro 8 project files.
* Download OpenGL SDK 1.2 from http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/opengl-sdk, and extract it into
the macos9 folder (in a folder called OpenGL_SDK_1.2)
* The 'lang' and 'Texturen' folders must be in the same folder as the billardgl application.
* I converted the lang files from DOS to Mac line endings (using dos2mac, but BBEdit or similar would also work).
